# rjvm [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/StackDoubleFlow/rjvm.svg?token=w2Qd2PZXZDMXJBYfVgvu&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/StackDoubleFlow/rjvm) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A work-in-progress jvm written completely in rust.

## Installation

As there are currently no releases, you must build from source.

If rust is not already installed, you can find out how [on their offcial website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/StackDoubleFlow/rjvm.git
cd rjvm
cargo build --release
```

Once complete, the binary will be located at `./target/release/rjvm` or `./target/release/rjvm.exe` depending on your os.

## Usage

For now, rjvm will only parse a class file, and print out it's contents as a structured output.

Example:

```shell
rjvm HelloWorld.java
```

It also has a help message generated by [structopt](https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt):
```shell
rjvm --help
```
